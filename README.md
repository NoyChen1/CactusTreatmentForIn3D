# 🌵 Cactus Treatment Simulator

A Unity-based simulation game created for in3D Tech's Unity Developer entry exam. This project showcases a cactus's lifecycle influenced by environmental parameters like water and oxygen. Designed with Unity's Universal Render Pipeline (URP), this project includes animations, custom shaders, particle effects, and a user-friendly GUI.

## 🎮 Features

- **Dynamic Lifecycle Simulation**:
  - The cactus's state (happy/sad) changes based on water and oxygen levels.
  - Visual feedback includes animations, particle effects, and facial expression changes.

- **Manual and Automatic Interactions**:
  - Players can manually adjust water and oxygen levels.
  - Automatic day/night cycle impacts the cactus's needs.

- **Custom Shaders**:
  - Unique shaders for visual effects, including a custom face texture for the cactus.
  - Shader to simulate environmental changes.

- **Responsive UI**:
  - UI elements update dynamically to reflect water and oxygen levels.
  - Day/night cycle visually represented in the interface.

- **Event-Driven Architecture**:
  - Actions and events handle state changes for clean and scalable code.
